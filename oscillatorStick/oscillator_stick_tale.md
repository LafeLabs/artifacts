## Oscillator Stick Tale

This is the latest version, as of May 2016, of my mechanical feedback oscillation driver. The background is that I was building vibrational motors for specific purposes and realized I could be and should be building something much more general. This has gone through various versions, involving fairly complex commercial circuit boards which I once thought I should crowd fund, parts epoxied to rocks, and parts made from melted bottle parts.  At the moment my circuits are made from sticks cut to shape with holes cut in them.  This particular model is fairly plane: no built in batteries, no real decoration or covering for the parts, just a USB cable for power drive, an amp, a transistor, a on/off button with LED, a drive coil and a sense coil.  

### Prophecy

What will happen to this particular unit?  I really have no idea!  I'm not going to sell it, maybe it will remain a demo?  Maybe I will give it away, but to whom, for what?  Probably for now it's a demo, will you be the next user?
